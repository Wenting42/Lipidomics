## **Lipidomics Project**

### Introduction
This analysis pipeline for mass spectrometry-based lipidomics (DDA) studies is being continuously developed and improved in the laboratory of Drs. Robert Farese, Jr. and Tobias Walther at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

### Installation
Requires R version 3.6.0 or newer. Any additional packages/libraries will be installed and loaded automatically. At present, pipeline supports mass-spectrometry derived data generated from LipidSearch (Thermo Fischer Scientific/Mitsui Knowledge Industry) or similar software for post-processing such quality control functions, statistical quantification and pathway visualization on experimental data.

### Caveats
For Mac users, please make sure XQaurtz is installed for prevent crashing.
