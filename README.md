## **Lipidomics Project**

### Introduction
Lipidomics pipeline is designed as a reference for lipidomcis experiment. The Mass Spectrometry based data collected via experiments will be read by Lipid Search software to generate search files. The pipeline provides R scripts to do quality control, statistics quantification and visualization on the data.

### Installation
